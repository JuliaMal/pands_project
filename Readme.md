# About the Fisherâ€™s Iris data set

One of the most common datasets in the data science world is called Iris flower data set.
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.

Fisher's Iris flower data set is an excellent example of a traditional resource that has become a staple of the computing world, especially for testing purposes. 
New types of sorting models and taxonomy algorithms often use the Iris flower data set as an input to examine how various technologies sort and handle data sets. 
The Iris flower data set has also been used to explore the world of data mining, as in its use by the IBM Watson analytics engine.

The dataset is a record of feature measurements (petal lengths and widths, sepal lengths and widths) of different species of Iris flowers. 

The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. 

Each row of the table represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.

One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. 

# Attribute Information:

1. sepal length (cm) 
2. sepal width (cm) 
3. petal length (cm)  
4. petal width (cm)  
5. class: 
	- Iris Setosa 
	- Iris Versicolour 
	- Iris Virginica

The data set has no null values.

# About the code:

1. The program calculates the average sepal length & width and petal length & width

2. The program also provides the user with 4 plots:
    - Box plot
    - Scatter plot
    - Violin plot (includes petal length & width data)
    - Violin plot (includes sepal length & width data)
